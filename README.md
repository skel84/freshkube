## Why talos-pilot?

Talos Linux removes SSH access for security, replacing it with an API-driven management model. While `talosctl` is powerful, it requires memorizing many subcommands. **talos-pilot** provides:

- **Interactive cluster overview** - See all nodes, services, and health at a glance
- **Real-time monitoring** - CPU, memory, network stats with auto-refresh
- **Unified log viewer** - Stream logs from multiple services simultaneously (Stern-style)
- **Production operations** - Drain, reboot, rolling upgrades with safety checks
- **Diagnostics** - Automated health checks with actionable fix suggestions

### Relationship to k9s

**talos-pilot is complementary to k9s, not a replacement.** They operate at different layers:

| Tool | Layer | API Port | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **k9s** | Kubernetes | `:6443` | Pods, deployments, services, workload debugging |
| **talos-pilot** | Operating System | `:50000` | Talos services, etcd, kubelet, node health, OS config |

Use **k9s** for "why won't my pod start?"
Use **talos-pilot** for "why won't my node join the cluster?"

## Design Philosophy

talos-pilot favors reliability in how it reports cluster health:

- State over logs: health is read from system state (procfs files, Talos and Kubernetes API responses), not from log lines. A stale error in an old log does not trigger a false alarm.
- Reliability hierarchy: checks prefer file and procfs state first, then API responses, then log parsing. Where a file like `/run/flannel/subnet.env` exists, it is read directly.
- No false positives: when a data source is unavailable, a check reports `unknown` rather than guessing or crashing.
- Separation of concerns: three crates. `talos-rs` is the gRPC client, `talos-pilot-core` holds the business logic and unit tests, and `talos-pilot-tui` is the ratatui UI. The logic can be tested without a terminal or a live cluster.

## Engineering Highlights

Some implementation notes:

- The Talos API is addressed at node endpoints directly, not through the cluster VIP. The VIP depends on a healthy control plane, so using it would break diagnostics when the control plane is down.
- The COSI resource API is not reachable on the public `:50000` port; a direct gRPC client gets `PermissionDenied`. talos-pilot shells out to `talosctl get` for that data instead.
- When the Talos discovery service is disabled, there is no membership list to read. talos-pilot enumerates and targets nodes through the Kubernetes API, so multi-node views and rolling operations still work.
- Packet capture streams pcap data back over the same `:50000` connection it runs on, so an unfiltered capture records its own traffic and loops. talos-pilot applies a BPF filter that drops traffic on the API port. It is precompiled with `tcpdump -dd` and embedded as bytecode (parameterized by port, with a variant per link type for IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP/SCTP, and fragmented packets), so no filter compiler is needed on the node.
- Business logic in `talos-pilot-core` is unit-tested without a terminal or a live node (47 tests). The workspace has 124 tests across the three crates and builds clean under `clippy -D warnings`.

./target/release/talos-pilot
```

### NixOS

Talos pilot is available as a Nix flake but can also be run without installing.

#### Run talos-pilot without installing

You can test the app directly by using a nix shell

```bash
nix shell github:Handfish/talos-pilot
```

Or run it directly

```bash
nix run github:Handfish/talos-pilot
```

#### Usage in flakes

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    talos-pilot.url = "github:Handfish/talos-pilot";
  };
  outputs =
    {
      self,
      nixpkgs,
      talos-pilot,
      # ...
    }:
    {
      nixosConfigurations.mymachine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        modules = [
          {
            # provides `pkgs.talos-pilot`
            nixpkgs.overlays = [ talos-pilot.overlays.default ];
          }
          (
            { pkgs, ... }:
            {
              # install talos-pilot
              environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.talos-pilot ];
            }
          )
        ];
      };
    };
}
```

### Requirements

- Valid `~/.talos/config` (talosconfig)
- Network access to Talos nodes on port 50000
- (Building from source) Rust 2024 edition (1.85+)

## Usage

```bash
# Use default context from talosconfig
talos-pilot

# Use specific context
talos-pilot --context homelab

# Set log tail limit
talos-pilot --tail 1000

# Enable debug logging
talos-pilot --debug --log-file ~/talos-pilot.log
```

### Bootstrap Wizard (Insecure Mode)

For bootstrapping new clusters on bare metal or VMs in maintenance mode, talos-pilot provides an interactive wizard:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0955b5a9-e35d-4fc6-a53d-db16e4558fc9

```bash
# Connect to a node in maintenance mode
talos-pilot --insecure --endpoint <node-ip>
```

The wizard guides you through:
1. **Generate Config** - Creates talosconfig, controlplane.yaml, and worker.yaml
2. **Apply Config** - Applies configuration to the node, triggering installation
3. **Bootstrap** - Initializes etcd and starts the Kubernetes cluster

Once complete, you can manage the cluster using standard talos-pilot commands.
