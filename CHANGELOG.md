# Changelog

## Unreleased: Freshkube

talos-pilot becomes **Freshkube**, a native desktop app for Talos Linux and Kubernetes clusters.

- The GPUI Kit desktop frontend is now the only interface. The terminal UI, the egui GUI and the Dioxus prototype were removed; upstream [talos-pilot](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot) keeps the terminal UI.
- Crates renamed: `talos-pilot-core` → `freshkube-core`, `talos-pilot-gpui` → `freshkube-desktop`; the binary is `freshkube`. The `--ui` option is gone, and `--fixture` opens the app with synthetic example data.
- Operations audit files move from `~/.talos-pilot/` to `~/.freshkube/`; debug pages open with `FRESHKUBE_PAGE` (was `TALOS_PILOT_GPUI_PAGE`).
- UI tests no longer need a feature flag and run with reduced motion, which fixed two dialog tests that failed deterministically.
- CI and release builds cover macOS only until GPUI's Linux and Windows builds are verified; Homebrew publishing to the upstream tap was removed.
- Kubernetes resource browsing, read-only and in progress: a KUBERNETES sidebar section groups kinds as Kubeli does, and the Resources page lists any kind through the server's table view, kept current by a watch, with a namespace picker and filter. In Talos mode it uses the cluster's Kubernetes connection from Talos.
- Kubernetes-only mode: without a talosconfig, or with `--kubernetes-only`, Freshkube browses Kubernetes alone. The sidebar lists the kubeconfig's contexts and connects to its current one, or to the one `--kube-context` names; a named context that is missing is reported, never replaced. Talos pages ask for a talosconfig.
- With wrapping on, resizing the logs panel lays out only the lines on screen and catches up the rest once the width holds, instead of every retained line on every step. [docs/LONG_LISTS.md](docs/LONG_LISTS.md) sets the rules for long lists.
- [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) records what comes next.

Entries below this one are talos-pilot's history.

## 0.1.11

Reliability release: node enumeration no longer depends on the Talos discovery service, and Kubernetes views always target the launched cluster.

### Bug Fixes

**Worker nodes missing when cluster discovery is disabled ([#25](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/25), [#22](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/22))**

0.1.10 fixed workers vanishing when `--config` broke context resolution, but they still disappeared whenever Talos cluster discovery returns no members. This is increasingly common: Sidero has disabled the Kubernetes discovery registry by default, leaving only the external `discovery.talos.dev` service registry — which hardened/airgapped clusters routinely turn off — so `talosctl get members` comes back empty as the norm, not the exception.

talos-pilot built its node roster from `talosctl get members`, and when that's empty it fell back to etcd membership — which only ever contains control-plane nodes — so workers dropped out (leaving the "cluster discovery returned no members" warning). It now falls back to the **Kubernetes API**, which knows every node (control plane and worker) independently of Talos discovery. The kubeconfig for that lookup is fetched directly from a control-plane node over the Talos API (certificate auth), so it always targets the correct cluster and never an unrelated one an ambient `KUBECONFIG` might point at. Displayed nodes still come from successful Talos queries, so unreachable/bogus IPs self-filter.

The same fallback is applied everywhere the app enumerates nodes independently of the main list:

- **Cluster node list** — workers appear again (and everything derived from it: rolling operations, per-node logs/processes/network/storage/operations).
- **Lifecycle (versions / config drift)** — the version-skew and config-drift table now covers all nodes, not just the endpoint the base client targets.

Reproduced on a discovery-disabled Docker cluster (1 control plane + 2 workers): before, both views showed the control plane only; after, all three nodes appear. Verified end-to-end + regression tests added.

**Lifecycle "Config" and "Time Sync" columns were always blank**

The Lifecycle node table showed `-` for every node's config version and time-sync status. Two causes: `talosctl get machineconfig` returns multiple YAML documents (the `persistent` and `v1alpha1` configs), but the parser tried to decode the whole blob as a single document and always errored; and per-node time-sync info was only fetched for the endpoint. Both are fixed — machineconfig parsing now splits documents and prefers the canonical `v1alpha1` config (tolerating a numeric `version`), and version + time-sync are queried per node — so the table is fully populated for control-plane and worker nodes alike. Regression tests added.

**Kubernetes views could target the wrong cluster when `KUBECONFIG` was set**

The workloads view and the drain/cordon operations build a Kubernetes client that preferred an ambient `KUBECONFIG` over the launched Talos context. If your shell's `KUBECONFIG` pointed at a *different* cluster than `--context`, read views silently showed the wrong cluster's data and — more seriously — drain/cordon could act on the wrong nodes.

These clients now pin to the launched cluster: the kubeconfig is fetched from a control-plane node over the Talos API, so it always identifies the cluster you asked for. An ambient `KUBECONFIG` is still honored when it names the **same** cluster (matched by cluster CA, so a VIP/load-balancer endpoint isn't mistaken for a different cluster) — preserving your configured, possibly more reachable endpoint — but is ignored when it names a different one. When it's ignored, a wrapped warning on the cluster view explains why, so nothing is silently overridden. Verified end-to-end against a cluster with a mismatched `KUBECONFIG`; regression tests added.

## 0.1.10

Reliability release focused on connectivity, node discovery, and node operations.

### Bug Fixes

**Multi-endpoint failover — app no longer hangs silently ([#27](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/27))**

talos-pilot now fails over across endpoints like `talosctl`: it dials all of a context's endpoints concurrently and uses the first that actually connects (bounded by a 10s timeout), so a dead first endpoint is skipped instead of hanging the session. The old "Successfully connected" log was just tonic's lazy channel, not a real handshake — hence the ~21s wait before the first RPC failed. Startup no longer blocks on a blank screen: there's now a cancellable "Connecting…" screen (q/Esc/Ctrl-C), and an all-unreachable cluster shows a clear Connection Error panel. Verified on a multi-endpoint cluster with the dead endpoint first — connects in ~2ms where it used to hang, so the reorder-endpoints workaround is no longer needed. (commit 9cab34f)

**Lifecycle/Versions view now fetches data ([#26](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/26))**

The Lifecycle view fetched the Talos version first and treated it as a hard gate: on failure it cleared its own error and returned early, skipping the etcd/K8s/pod checks entirely (hence zero follow-up requests and the silent "unknown" fields). Now a version-fetch failure just logs a warning and continues; the other checks fire regardless, and you only get an error banner if the whole refresh comes back empty. Regression tests added. (commit 1ce1e01)

**Worker nodes no longer missing ([#25](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/25), [#22](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/22))**

talos-pilot fetches the full node list (workers included) via `talosctl get members`, but it wasn't passing `--talosconfig`, so if you ran with `--config <path>` talosctl fell back to the default `~/.talos/config`, couldn't find your context, and the list silently collapsed to just the control-plane nodes. It now passes your config through correctly. Node roles are now determined from the discovery `machineType` (not inferred from the etcd service), and if worker discovery genuinely can't run (discovery service disabled, or `talosctl` not on PATH) you'll now see a visible warning instead of a silently short list. Verified end-to-end + tests added. (commit fd5080f)

**"No K8s client available" when rebooting a node ([#23](https://github.com/Handfish/talos-pilot/issues/23))**

When you open node operations, talos-pilot builds a Kubernetes client to run the pre-drain safety checks. It was only trying your environment kubeconfig and then a VIP fallback — and since we build kube-rs without the exec/OIDC auth plugins, a kubeconfig that `kubectl` accepts (e.g. EKS/OIDC) could fail to load, leaving no client, so the reboot bailed out with the generic "No K8s client available". It now fetches the kubeconfig directly from a control-plane node over the Talos API (certificate auth, always available), so it no longer depends on your local kubeconfig's auth method. And if a client genuinely can't be created, you'll now see the specific reason instead of the generic message. Verified that drain/reboot safety checks load even with no usable local kubeconfig. (commit 49814c7)
